Please can you complete an exercise as detailed below. Please make sure you check your work in regularly.

Before you start:

1.    Set up an account on bitbucket.org

2.    Create a repository called ‘Candidate Name Fizz Buzz ‘ where candidate name is your own name. Share the repository with Neil Allen (neil.allen@aviva.com) and Nick Morgan (nick.morgan@aviva.com).

3.    Create an empty project, and check it in.

The application:

·         Should be a web application, either .Net Core or .Net 6 MVC project

·         Should be correctly architected, as if this was a production application, showing use of patterns and SOLID principles

·         Should be built using a ‘test first’ methodology

·         It is not important that you complete every step in the exercise

·         It is important that all submitted code is of good quality. Refactor as necessary.

Please check in your code to Bitbucket regularly.

Also, check in your code after every step, and label it ‘Step 1’, ‘Step 2’ etc. 

Basic Fizz-Buzz:
 
The user should be able to enter a positive integer
You should print out, in a vertical list, all of the values between 1 and the entered value
Where the number is divisible by 3, you should instead print ‘fizz’
Where the number is divisible by 5, you should instead print ‘buzz’
Where the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, you should instead print ‘fizz buzz’
Add validation to ensure the entered value is an integer between 1 and 1000
Add styling so ‘fizz’ is printed in blue, and ‘buzz’ in green
Change the logic so that if today is Wednesday, the words ‘wizz’ and ‘wuzz’ are substituted for ‘fizz’ and ‘buzz
Amend the program so only 20 values are displayed at a time. Implement ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons to display the remaining values.
A RESTful web service is required to record the user entered values.
 
Design and document this web service
Implement it as a mock or stub in your code.
